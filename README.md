# Support-Vector-Machine
This project showcases binary classification using Support Vector Machines (SVMs) with both linear and RBF (non-linear) kernels on synthetic 2D data. It includes:

Data generation using make_moons

Feature scaling for optimal SVM performance

Training and comparison of linear vs RBF SVMs

Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV

Evaluation with 5-fold cross-validation

Visualization of decision boundaries

The goal is to demonstrate the difference between linear and non-linear decision boundaries and how tuning parameters like C and gamma can affect classification performance.
